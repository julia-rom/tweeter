# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository had [starter code](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/tweeter) for the project. The rest was up to me to use HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies
